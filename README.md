# Denextel-Python-Tools

Denextel's Python Tool Suite is going to be a set of modules for Python to make longer tasks quicker, simpler and easier, like making key bindings and tkinter windows. We believe that it should be as simple as 'bind(key,function)'.
So far, our computer program for displays has worked, so we will start to move on to key bindings and encrypted save files.
